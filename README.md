# koop-cli-new-app

An opinionated koop app template for [koop-cli](https://github.com/haoliangyu/koop-cli).

This is a fork of [koop-sample-app](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-sample-app) with several differences:

* Minimal

  This template drops unnecessary files and dependencies from the original app example.

* No configuration

  This template requires no configuration and it is up to the developer to choose how to configurate it.
